    "Looking at these  plots its clear to see that even when we extend the smokers case to all the people that do smoke that excess charges is always common between the population. Now we have a larger population we can draw a more concrete conclusion, the regression plot shows us that most of the above average charges are associated with smokers this is further backed up by the bar plot which shows almost all of the population of smokers have above average charges, the final nail for the argument that smoking is the leading factor in higher than average charges is the box plot which shows no outliers and the smallest fee being only just below the excessive charges threshold."
